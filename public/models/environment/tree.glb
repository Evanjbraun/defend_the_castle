// This is a binary GLB file that contains a simple tree model
// The model consists of:
// 1. A cylinder for the trunk
// 2. A cone for the foliage
// 3. Materials for both parts
// 4. Proper hierarchy and transformations

// Note: This is a placeholder. You'll need to create an actual GLB file
// using a 3D modeling tool like Blender or export from Three.js
// The file should be placed in the public/models/environment directory
