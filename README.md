# Defend The Castle

A third-person action defense game built with Three.js where players control a character defending their castle against waves of enemies. This project was mostly a fun side project I wanted to work on to toy around with newer technologies.

## Features

- Third-person character control
- Wave-based enemy spawning system
- Castle defense mechanics
- Tower placement and management
- Hero abilities and combat system
- Dynamic difficulty scaling

## Tech Stack

- Three.js for 3D rendering
- Cannon.js for physics
- React for UI components
- Webpack for bundling
- ESLint/Prettier for code quality
